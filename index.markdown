[Administration][administration] has been split into separate scripts with specific and shared functions. Most if not all scripts (including [`git-shell-commands`][git-shell-commands]) maybe run with `--help` to display select documentation within the terminal.


> Examples will include administrators named _`Elizabeth`_ and _`Joanna`_, and `Git`/`Jekyll` users named _`Bill`_ and _`Ted`_, so as to _liven up_ the documentation experience.
