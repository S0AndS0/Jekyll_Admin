I try to build cool stuff and put it online, the following's a list of where this sorta started;


- April of 2013 I posted a substantial amount of notes regarding [installing Linux on Android][guide-linux-on-android] on `XDA Forums`

- July of 2013 I demonstrated one method of [installing MapTools][guide-maptools-on-android] within a Linux running withing Android on `RPTools Forums`... yeah I'm a bit twisted like that, though it later came in handy for maybe answering a question posted on `Raspberry Pi Forums` for making a [table top][guide-maptools-on-rpi] gaming experience

- November of 2013 I think I joined the [StackExchange] network of sites, and began answering questions that intrigue or that I believe I can aid in resolving.

- June of 2014 I joined a Bitcoin (and related technologies) forum, sharing scripts and guides for [`minderd`][script-cpu-minerd-installer] installation. Latter I became one of three Moderators, though now content like that only exist online thanks to `archive.org`.


These days I `git push` quite a bit of code and documentation to [GitHub], latest projects involve [3D_Printing] short-cuts with `Blender`, and [Jekyll_Admin]istration via `Bash`, `git`, and `ssh` automation.


- Documentation for [3D_Printing Short-Cuts][docs-3D_Printing] is hosted on GitHub Pages, which covers installation of an add-on written in `Python` for slicing and uploading meshes to print servers.

- As is documentation for [Jekyll Administration][docs-Jekyll_Admin] that dives into multi-user multi-admin setups for locally or privately building static sites with `Jekyll` on a remote server.


Not everything I write is good, the further back in time one goes the worse it gets, though I think the world is already full of _a good examples_
