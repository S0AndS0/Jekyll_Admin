Please review the [Bash Styling][docs_styling_bash] tips for column (width) and line-length (hight) _soft_ limits.


- Make use of the `_includes` directory; please keep it tidy as far as additions there.

- Test edits to existing code with a private server before `push`ing to GitHub, see related [contributing][docs_contributing_pages] page for hints on set-up.
