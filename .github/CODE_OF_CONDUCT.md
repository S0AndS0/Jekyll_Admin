about: Guidelines to having a _good time_ with others here
title: Code of Conduct (Under Construction)
---

This document maybe updated at any point that it becomes necessary (probably better that no one does anything that requires edits to be made), for now here's some general tips;


- Code and documentation related to the code is what this project is about.

- Treat others as though they have access to your tooth-brush.

- _Bonus Points_ may be awarded for keeping the _mood_ light, or awarded arbitrarily.


> There is currently no _gift shops_ (or anywhere) that _Bonus Points_ maybe redeemed for anything of monetary value, nor is there any interest that may be accrued by holding some sum of _Bonus Points_ for any length of time, and at this time _Bonus Points_ are non-transferable. Additionally at this time, and likely _most_ future times, _Bonus Points_ do __not__ grant the holder any _powers_, such as but not limited to; transmutation of maple syrup to sugar-free strawberry, flight so long as no one is watching, and/or share-holder's stake in any company.
